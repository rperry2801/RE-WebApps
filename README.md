# RE-WebApps

This ReadMe file will always have the most recent status update of this project. The purpose of this project is to create a web application that allows for real-time messaging, as well as potential file sharing and extra security features along with this. There will also be real-estate data (looking into a Zillow API) and a ticketing system that assigns different leads to different sales reps (much like a CRM).

Currently, the project will need to be created under the django framework as well as a command-line virtual environment. Afterwards the commands "django-admin startproject REWebApps" and "py manage.py startapp rtMesssaging" will create most of the framework layout that will be uploaded to this repository.
