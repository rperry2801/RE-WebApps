# RE-WebApps

This ReadMe file will always have the most recent status update of this project. The purpose of this project is to create a web application that allows for real-time messaging, as well as potential file sharing and extra security features along with this.

Currently, the project will need to be set up in the django framework with the following versions and commands: Python 3.10, Django 4.1
C:\Directory> py -m venv venv
(venv) C:\Directory> py -m pip install django
(venv) C:\Directory> django-admin startproject WebApps

After some initial development on the server-side and the chat application, I will also create an application:
(venv) C:\Directory> py manage.py startapp rtmesssaging

From there back-end development and testing will continue for the messaging section of the apps.
