# RE-WebApps

This ReadMe file will always have the most recent status update of this project. The purpose of this project is to create a web application that allows for real-time messaging, as well as potential file sharing and extra security features along with this. There will also be real-estate data (looking into a Zillow API) and a ticketing system that assigns different leads to different sales reps (much like a CRM).

CURRENT STATUS: Creating the "CRM" aspect of the website, user management was created along with the initial css and front-end development. Now I am focusing on making it so leads can be created by users and that users can make and edit their own leads:
  - Designate leads to certain users
  - Block signed in users from seeing other user's leads (with the exception of managers who can see it in the Django Admin site)
  - Create drop-down showing lead status and create lead organization by status
  - Gather data on sold leads to show how many deals have been made/sold in the past week-month for the front page
